# Hackaton-DataCrunch
This code is from an online hackaton named DataCrunch.

I got to learn a lot of data analysis. I learn how to manage data using Pandas, and manage incomplete data.

Also I aproached the objective with the plan of testing as many type of models as possible, and create a voting system among the top models.
I didn't have time to create a functional voting system, as the amount of data and the models were huge and it was very hard to manage all of them at the same time.

My results were mediocre, but I learned a lot.
